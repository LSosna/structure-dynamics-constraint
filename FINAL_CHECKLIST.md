## 📊 QUANTITATIVE CONSTRAINT (ApJ-Perfect Framing)

**Abstract:** "...correlation amplitude is reduced by ≥85-90%, placing a 
stringent upper bound on any direct coupling..."

**Section 4:** "...constrain any physically meaningful coupling to ≤10-15% 
of the signal implied by kinematically tuned models."

This converts the paper from a "negative result" to a **precision constraint**.
