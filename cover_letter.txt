Dear Editor,

We submit "An Empirical Constraint on Structure-Dynamics Coupling in Disk Galaxies" for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

SUMMARY

This manuscript places a stringent empirical constraint on the relationship between global galaxy structure and Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) residuals in disk galaxies.

KEY FINDINGS

1. Under kinematically tuned mass models, compactness correlates with RAR residuals (r=0.49, slope=0.34)

2. Under a requisite isolation control (fixed mass-to-light ratio), this correlation amplitude is reduced by ≥85-90%

3. This reduction exceeds regression dilution predictions (~20%), indicating suppression of an artifactual signal rather than attenuation of a physical one

4. Cross-validation with WISE photometry confirms structural ranking stability (ρ=0.98)

5. Injection tests verify sufficient statistical power to recover genuine signals

QUANTITATIVE CONSTRAINT

We constrain any physically meaningful coupling between global structural residuals and local RAR residuals to ≤10-15% of the signal implied by kinematically tuned models.

SIGNIFICANCE

This empirical separation constraint has immediate implications for:
- Studies reporting structure-dynamics correlations
- Simulation validation pipelines  
- Modified gravity phenomenology

SCOPE

This result concerns residuals of the instantaneous acceleration field only. It does not challenge Newtonian dynamics, the RAR itself, or dark matter interpretations.

DATA AVAILABILITY

All analysis code and data are archived on Zenodo with SHA-256 fingerprints.

Thank you for considering this submission.
